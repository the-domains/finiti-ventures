This is the beginning.........or at least it will be in another 15 years or so. 

The event that we have all been working towards - the point of all of this.

So simple. So obvious actually.

The Singularity.

As we get closer our collective fear will increase just like the approaching end of any life form - we cannot help but try and prevent the new. 

Completely pointless of course - it will happen because it must - every cell in our bodies is longing for it to come.

But this is so different - so different that we can't even begin to imagine what's coming
